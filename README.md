# Convolutional_Vision_Transformer_Numpy_Only_From_Scratch

This is to share the Python file to build a Convolutional Vision Transformer from scratch. The purpose of the Numpy-only is to show the important steps that might not be seen by using Pytorch or other packages.

There are three files here:

ConVIT_logic_flow.py gives the very nature flow of the whole module without heavily using functions. It might be easy for first time learner.

ConVIT_training_file.py this is to train your model, but some of hyperparameters need to be adjust first before the training, they all marked.

ConVIT_work_AI.py basically, after the training, with the updated weights, this file can run well to predict/descirbe the image.

All the files can run directly, some example random matrix was fabracated as the input data to make sure the code can run, at least.

Have fun.
