# Convolutional_Vision_Transformer_Numpy_Only_From_Scratch

This is to share the Python file to build a Convolutional Vision Transformer from scratch. The purpose of the Numpy-only is to show the important steps that might be seen by using Pytorch or other packages.

ConVIT_Training_file.py gives the very nature flow of the whole module without heavily using functions. It might be easy for first time learner.

A more rounded file will be uploaded soon.
